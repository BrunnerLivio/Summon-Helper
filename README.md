![Summon Helper Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrunnerLivio/summon-helper/master/.github/preview.png)

Since 13w36a it is possible to summon entities using the /summon Command. 
Unfortunately Mojang does not offer a big support for this.
This website is here for helping you with your summon commands 
without writing long lines of codes

## Installation

1. Install NodeJS
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm run start` to start the application


## Contribute
Not many rules except it must work. I literally don't care, because the whole project is a mess
and hacked together. So feel free to create pull request and contribute. 

## Note
Beware; really ugly code. I began this project when I was 13 years old. Good luck!
